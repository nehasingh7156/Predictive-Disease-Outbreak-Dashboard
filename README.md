# AEGIS-AI-Powered-Disease-Outbreak-Intelligence-Early-Warning-System
AEGIS is an AI-driven epidemiological intelligence platform designed to detect, monitor, predict, and visualize infectious disease outbreaks across India.

The platform combines machine learning, graph analytics, environmental monitoring, and real-time intelligence generation to provide actionable insights for healthcare authorities, public health agencies, and disaster response teams.

AEGIS integrates disease surveillance data, weather patterns, water quality reports, hospital admissions, and outbreak predictions into a unified dashboard powered by Neo4j Graph Database.
